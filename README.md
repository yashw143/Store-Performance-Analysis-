# Store-Performance-Analysis-
Using Excel to Visualize Sales and Inventory Data
As a part of a store analysis project, I utilized Excel to generate actionable insights and created an interactive dashboard to showcase the results. 
This allowed me to effectively communicate the store's performance metrics and make data-driven recommendations for future improvements.

*Maharashtra, Karnataks and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 states (~35%)
